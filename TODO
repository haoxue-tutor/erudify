Hmm, we can do away with having a tiled course. A list of words is enough. We
can pick exercises on the fly. This should be fast enough. We can show a status:
number of words seen, total number of words in list, number of words to be
reviewed. Once all words have been seen and reviewed, we can overtrain on words
with the nearest repeat date.

Key components:
- (UserModel, WordList) -> Word
  - Pick word with the nearest repeat date in the past.
  - If no such word, pick the next word in the word list.
- (UserModel, Set Exercise, Word) -> Exercise
  - Cost model:
    - Known words are free.
    - Novel words: Number of new words _not_ in course
    - Future words: Number of new words in course.
    - Seen date: Last seen date of the exercise.
- (UserModel, Exercise, Response) -> UserModel
- Exercise -> UI

Commands:
  - Sort word list by frequency.
  - Take word list. For each unique word, find best exercise. Keep track of which words has already been
seen. Introducing no new words is best. Introducing words that are coming later is okay. Introducing
words not the text is a last resort. Show list of words that are introduced too soon, and list of
words that are introduced needlessly. Take list of basic words that should be assumed to be known.
